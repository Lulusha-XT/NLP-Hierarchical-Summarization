# Hierarchical Summarization with Query

This script performs hierarchical summarization of two input documents and generates a query based on the final summary. The summary is created iteratively, taking into account the context window limit. The NLTK library is used for text preprocessing and natural language processing tasks.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the dependencies using the following:

```bash
pip install nltk
```
